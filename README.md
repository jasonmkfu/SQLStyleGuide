# The Readability SQL Style Guide

Want to get straight to the good stuff?  Jump to the [guide](https://github.com/jasonmkfu/the-readability-sql-style-guide/blob/main/Style%20Guide.md)!

## Overview
SQL styling varies greatly from person to person.  This style guide defines a single way for all styles and seeks to explain the reasoning behind that choice.  The style guide often chooses readability over efficiency or succinctness.

# Using the Guide
## Consistency
While there are many ways to style SQL code, the number one rule, regardless ofstyle choice, is to remain consistent.  Switching styles throughout a query decreases readability.
## Markdown Reader
The Readability Style Guide is perfectly usable from within Github, however, opening the markdown document in a markdown editor such as Visual Studio Code will allow you to see highlighted sections of SQL that further assists understanding the definition of each style.

## Further Discussion Sections
In cases where the choice of the style is very debatable, an additional section is included to further explain the reasoning for the choice of the style.  Readers will most likely still disagree with the provided expplanations, they are included to explain the thought process about the stylechoice.  Finally, the explanations are placed in a drop down section as they are not essential to the style guide, but included for the curious reader.
